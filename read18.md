Introduction to AWS CloudWatch

1.Explain CloudWatch Events to a non-technical friend. In a nutshell, CloudWatch Events is like having a digital assistant that watches over your systems, alerts you when something important happens, and even takes care of routine tasks on its own. It's all about making sure your digital world works seamlessly without you having to constantly keep an eye on it.

2. What do CloudWatch Logs helps us achieve? CloudWatch Logs helps users to access, monitor & store access log files from AWS resources like EC2, Lambda functions, CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources. CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. With the help of CloudWatch Logs, you can troubleshoot your systems and applications. It offers near real-time monitoring and users can search, filter for specific phrases, values or patterns. Metric filters define the patterns and the terms to look for in log data as it is sent to CloudWatch Logs. You can use subscriptions to get access to a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs and have it delivered to other services such as an Amazon Kinesis Stream, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream or AWS Lambda for custom processing, analysis or loading to other systems.

3. What capabilities does CloudWatch Anomaly detection have? Learn and model the expected behavior of a metric based on prior data.
Calculate expected values and generates the Anomaly Detection band. This is based on a lower and an upper band metric generated by the model. Metric values that fall outside the predicted confidence band are considered anomalies.
Enable you to create alarms based on the Anomaly Detection band and remediate detected anomalies.
