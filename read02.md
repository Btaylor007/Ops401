1.Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background. AWS abstracts away the complexity of managing physical hardware and allows users to focus on building, deploying, and managing applications and services without getting into the nitty-gritty details of the underlying infrastructure. It provides a range of services catering to different levels of technical expertise and business requirements.
