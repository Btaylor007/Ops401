Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer

What Are MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Hashes, and How Do I Check Them?

You have been made responsible for the company’s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.In the digital world, this "magic stamp" is like a hash function. It takes the content of a file or message and turns it into a unique code. If the content changes, even a tiny bit, the code will change too. Checking this code is a way to ensure that your data hasn't been messed with during its journey.

How is hashing and encryption different? hashing is about creating a fixed-size representation of data to verify its integrity, while encryption is about transforming data to make it unreadable, with the ability to reverse the process using a key for authorized access
