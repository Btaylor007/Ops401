The Pros and Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems

1.List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS? 
while both firewalls and IDS contribute to network security, firewalls primarily control and regulate network traffic based on predetermined rules, whereas IDS passively monitors and analyzes network activities to detect potential security threats and generate alerts for further investigation.


2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS? If the primary concern is securing the network perimeter and detecting external threats before they reach individual hosts
  

3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?
Despite these drawbacks, NIDS remains an important component of a comprehensive security strategy. To address some of these limitations, organizations often combine NIDS with other security measures, such as Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), endpoint protection, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, to create a more robust defense against a wide range of threats.
