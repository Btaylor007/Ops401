1.What are some of the key features of the VPC model? Agility: Control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources whenever your business needs them. You can scale these resources dynamically and in real-time.

Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean your applications and workloads are highly available.

Security: Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom.

Affordability: VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources.

3. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.  A VPN is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It extends a private network across a public network, allowing users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network.A VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS (Amazon Web Services) account. It enables you to launch Amazon Web Services resources into a virtual network that you've defined.
