AWS re:Inforce 2019: Threat Detection on AWS: An Introduction to Amazon GuardDuty (FND216)

What are some of the IoCs that GuardDuty can detect? A managed threat detection service by AWS (Amazon Web Services), detects various types of indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to potential security threats within AWS environments. 

What are some of the data sources which GuardDuty can use? GuardDuty uses the foundational data sources to detect communication with known malicious domains and IP addresses and identify anomalous behavior. While in transit from these sources to GuardDuty, all of the log data is encrypted. GuardDuty extracts various fields from these logs sources for profiling and anomaly detection, and then discards these logs

How does GuardDuty use access behavior to spot potential malicious activity? The service looks for deviations from normal access patterns and employs machine learning algorithms to identify potentially suspicious or malicious behavior.
